    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I like to consider myself a man of many interests. So here are a few activities I like to engage in, but in the interest of full disclosure, some of them may shock you.
        This list is presented in no defined order:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nature, wildlife, and landscape photography</li>
            <li>Cooking (I especially enjoy trying out new recipes)</li>
            <li>Baking (I know, some people consider baking and cooking to be the same, but I like to make the distinction)</li>
            <li>Reading (I like novels and thrillers)</li>
            <li>Singing</li>
            <li>Conversations (erm, productive ones... I do not enjoy arguments)</li>
            <li>Hiking (alone or in a group, just make sure to keep up with my fast pace)</li>
            <li>Faith (from studying my Bible to praying, I feel centered when I spend time with God)</li>
            <li>Movies (whether its watching them or having conversations about them, I am a bonafide movie enthusiast!)</li>
            <li>Eating (I am something of a foodie, although, I am not known for my great appetite)</li>
            <li>Sleeping (because at my core, I am an introvert whose idea of heaven is laying on my bed 24/7 with absolutely nothing to do)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>So if I seem to be your cup of tea, why don't you reach out to me on my <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> page? 
        I promise I don't bite.</p>
